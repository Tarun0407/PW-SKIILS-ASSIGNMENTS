Yes, you can use the underscore (_) as a variable name in Python. It is a valid identifier, and it is often used in various contexts, such as in loops where you don't need the loop variable, or as a placeholder for a variable that you don't intend to use.

Here's an example:

_ = 10
print(_)  # Outputs: 10
